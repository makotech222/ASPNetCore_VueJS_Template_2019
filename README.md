# ASPNetCore_VueJS_Template_2019
A template project for AspNetCore 2.1 + Vue.js SPA

This template is intended for more classic devs who don't want to dive into webpack head first and would rather have a more classic web application in ASP.Net Core. This is still a SPA application, however, so 
all routing is done through Vue.js Router.

This template builds with:
- VS 2019
- ASP.NET Core 2.1
- Vue 2.6.10
- VueX
- Vue Router
- Setup with Vue CLI 3.7

This application can be opened in VS2019 and run with debugger in a local environment without any messy configuration. 
When running in debug mode locally through VS2019, the server automatically runs the npm serve command to host the files for easy debugging/hot-reloading.
